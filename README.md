This project explores the use of artificial neural networks to predict graduate school admissions. By training on historical data—including GRE scores, GPA, and other relevant features—the ANN model learns underlying patterns to estimate the likelihood of admission. Through iterative optimization during training, the network enhances its predictive accuracy, offering a practical application of deep learning in the education domain.
